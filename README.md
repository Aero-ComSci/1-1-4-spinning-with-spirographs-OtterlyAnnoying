# 1.1.4Spirographs

*Complete the following.*

1. Compare and contrast zero-iteration conditions and infinite loops.
   **A zero-iteration condition is when a loop never starts because the conditions for the loop to start aren't met.  For example, if a loop is contingent on a certain variable having a certain value, but the variable in question has a different value and doesn't change, then this is a zero iteration condition and the loop never starts as a result.  An infinite loop is the opposite - it starts as the conditions are met, and since the conditions are never edited in the loop to make them not be met, the loop becomes an infinite loop.  An example of this would be when a loop is contingent on a variable having the certain value, and while the variable does have this variable and the loop starts, since the value of the variable never changes inside the loop, the loop never ends and it repeats infinitely. **
3. A link to your code where you solve the following problem. Take the screen size of 800px. Create code or algorithm that always places the object(s), up to 5, in the center an equal distance from one another and from the edges of the screen.
4. Concentric Squares -- Add a screenshot of your result and the code to create it on your repo.
Objective: Write a Python program using the turtle module to draw a pattern of concentric squares. The pattern should be created using nested loops.

Instructions:

Setup the Turtle Environment:
Import the turtle module.
Create a turtle object.
Set the turtle speed to the fastest setting.
Draw Concentric Squares:
Use a nested loop to draw multiple squares.
The outer loop should control the number of squares.
The inner loop should draw each square.
Each square should be slightly larger than the previous one.
Customize the Pattern:
Use different colors for each square.
Ensure the squares are centered on the screen.
Example Output:

The turtle should draw a series of squares, each one larger than the last, creating a pattern of concentric squares.

Hints:

Use the penup() and pendown() methods to move the turtle without drawing.
Use the color() method to change the turtleâ€™s color.
Use the forward() and right() methods to draw the sides of the squares.


4. Complete the steps 17, 18 and 19 from [mypltw use clever to sign on](https://pltw.read.inkling.com/a/b/5310c007377c46e28d745961310f0c2e/p/728c751a6c4145bea0ea83c5058fb9f9#44b0003a2ee14fcc9865e7bb5faec747)
5. Answer to step 21
   **This algorithm creates an infinite loop of drawing circles.  It sets a variable answer as 'y', and makes a while loop that operates while the value of answer is 'y'.  In each iteration of the loop, the turtle creates a circle after moving up and right.  However, since the variable answer never changes, the loop is infinite.**
7. Insert a screenshot or picture of the algorithm you used for your tokenizer on the previous activity.
8. Give an example of an undecidable problem, attach code.
